<span class="smcap">Dear Girls</span>:

<p>This book tells the story of Mary Frances, a little
girl whose great ambition was to help her mother.
So anxious was she to do this that even the humble
Kitchen People became her teachers and instructors.
They talked to her, a thing never heard of before;
helped her over the hard places, and explained mysterious
secrets she could never otherwise have understood.
They wove around a simple little book of
recipes her mother had made for her the spell of
Fairyland; they led her through a series of delightful
adventures such as never happened to any girl before,
in which she lived for three whole happy weeks, and
out of which she emerged no longer a little girl, but
a real little woman.</p>

<p>Some very wise people would call this a story
book, some a manual training book, and others a
cookery book, but Mary Frances knows better; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
knows that it is a Book within a Book that introduced
her to Aunty Rolling Pin and a lot of other dear, dear
friends, such as no little girl ever had before, and whom
she now wishes to introduce for the first time to all
other little girls. (I know that she gained their consent
to do this because she told me so.)</p>

<p>In the hope that Mary Frances' wish may be
realized, this record of her adventures is sent out to
the girls of America with the best wishes of</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE KITCHEN PEOPLE</div>


<div class='cap'>ALL the Kitchen People were terribly excited.</div>

<p>"I see my finish!" puffed Tea Kettle from
his perch on the stove.</p>

<p>"That's slang!" snapped Sauce Pan, who sat
near by.</p>

<p>"Slang or no slang," said Tea Kettle, "I'll melt if
somebody doesn't come fill me soon."</p>

<p>"Where's the cook? Where's the mistress?" asked
Boiler Pan.</p>

<p>"Why, the cook's left&mdash;left this morning and the
mistress's sick. What's that I smell burning?"</p>

<p>"That's the potatoes in the oven," said
Toaster.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lid!" cried Tea Kettle holding his nose.
"Pour on water! Quick!"</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Coffee Pot.</p>

<p>"Whew!" cried Pie Plate.</p>

<p>"Whew!" clanged Big Iron Pot.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i015a.jpg" width="165" height="739" alt="Stove" title="" />
</div>
<p>"Whew!" mimicked Sauce Pan. "Whew!&mdash;That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
won't help! If you say Whew! to an oven door, will
it open?&mdash;Somebody open the door!"</p>

<p>"Good idea, Saucy!" exclaimed Tea Kettle. "You
might try it yourself!"</p>

<p>"Owoooh! O-w-o-o-o-h!" strained little Sauce Pan
at the heavy door. "O-w-o-o-o-h! I can't-t budge
it! Cauch! Cawc! Ochee!" he coughed. "What
smoke! Somebody else come try!"</p>

<p>"Get out of the way, then," said Big Iron Pot,
making heavily toward the stove.</p>

<p>"Knew your arms were too short," laughed Tea
Kettle, seeing Iron Pot couldn't reach the knob.</p>

<p>"Well, they're as long as yours," said Iron Pot
angrily.</p>

<p>"Kick it open!" sug-gest-ed Sauce Pan. "Everybody
allowed one kick!"</p>

<p>"First go!" exclaimed Iron Pot.</p>

<p>Whack! came a muffled sound. Then, "Oh, my
poor feet! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Sauce Pan.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Big Iron Pot, hopping around on
one little leg, and holding the other with his hands.
"Only I wish you'd had 'First go!'"</p>

<p>"Well," declared Tea Kettle, "unless help comes
soon, we may as well give up all hope of rescue. This
is dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Listen, then," ticked Mantel Clock, who didn't
mind the smoke. "I know a secret: the dear little
girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we know!" cried the Kitchen People.</p>

<p>"Well!" asked Mantel Clock, "what do you know?"</p>

<p>"The little girl&mdash;that there is a little girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that all you know?" demanded Mantel Clock.
"Now, when people interrupt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just dying to tell," said Sauce Pan in a loud
whisper.</p>

<p>"Please, please, tell us the secret," begged the
Kitchen People.</p>

<p>"Well," Mantel Clock ran on, "the dear little girl
that lives in our house is going to learn to cook. What
d'you say if we all turn in and help her?"</p>

<p>"Goody-goody!" Aunty Rolling Pin laughed so
she nearly rolled off the table.</p>

<p>Just then the kitchen door-knob turned, and every
one of the Kitchen People was as quiet as a</p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, you poor Tea Kettle!" she cried. "You'll
boil to death!" and she pulled it over to the
cooler part of the stove.</p>

<p>Tea Kettle simmered his thanks.</p>

<p>"What can be burning?" she asked. "What can
it be?" and she looked all over the stove.</p>

<p>"I do believe it's something in the oven!"</p>

<p>As she pulled open the oven door, out rolled the
burnt potatoes.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "now, for the toast," and she
caught up her mother's apron from a hook, and tied
it just under her arms, crossing the strings in front.</p>

<p>The Kitchen People held their breath to see what
would happen next.</p>

<p>Suddenly she clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" she cried, and ran out of the
room. In a minute she was back, with a little book in
her hands.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother was asleep," she whispered as though her
mother was still in danger of being wakened by any
sound&mdash;"but I just tip-toed up to the table, and got
the book she's been making for my cooking lessons.
This must be it&mdash;it's Mother's writing:</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 112px;">
<img src="images/i018a.jpg" width="112" height="257" alt="With a little book in her hands" title="" />
</div>

<div class='center'>
'The Mary Frances' First Cook Book.'<br />
</div>

<p>I believe&mdash;I just believe it tells about toast. Yes,
here it is, right on the first page:</p>
<div class='center'><span class="smcap">No. 1.&mdash;Plain Toast.</span></div>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Cut stale bread into slices, about &frac12; inch thick.</p>

<p>2. Remove crusts.</p>

<p>3. Put into wire toaster.</p>

<p>4. Hold over a fire, moving to and fro until a golden brown color.</p>

<p>5. Turn, and brown the other side.</p></div>

<p>"Let's see if there is any stale bread. I should
think so! a whole loaf! Now, I'll cut two slices, and
since I want it to be very nice, I'll cut off the crusts.
I guess that will be enough; oh, how I wish somebody
was here to help me."</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> somebody&mdash;<i>I'll</i> help!"</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/i018b.jpg" width="403" height="228" alt="&quot;There is somebody&mdash;I&#39;ll help!&quot;" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Frances looked round in amazement. Seeing
no one, "Why,&mdash;where? Why,&mdash;who are <i>you?</i>" she
asked.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/i019a.jpg" width="128" height="265" alt="&quot;And I!&quot;" title="" />
</div>
<p>"I'm Tea Kettle, Miss," said Tea Kettle, lifting
his lid very politely. "I'm gladly at your service, if
you please."</p>

<p>"And I!" It was Sauce Pan.</p>

<p>"And I!" cried Boiler Pan.</p>

<p>Mary Frances could scarcely believe her ears.</p>

<p>"My," she said, "can you all talk? and will you
help me? Isn't that grand!&mdash;But how you did s'prise
me! Won't we have a lovely time!"</p>

<p>"Look at the fire! Look at the fire!"</p>

<p>"What a tiny voice!" thought the little girl,&mdash;but
she quickly took the lids off the stove. Some very
bright coals stared up at her.</p>

<p>"The fire is fine," she said aloud, and she looked all
about to find where the voice came from, but she saw no
one.</p>

<p>"Look down, please!" said the same tiny voice,
this time very distinctly.</p>

<p>There stood the funniest little wire man, no higher
than the little girl's elbow.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i019b.jpg" width="334" height="202" alt="&quot;And I!&quot;" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"You didn't see me," laughed the little man,
"but I know how to make toast."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i020a.jpg" width="100" height="308" alt="&quot;You didn&#39;t see me&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Of course!" said the little girl, "you're&mdash;why,
you're the Toaster!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said the little man, with a bow,
"at your service, Miss Mary Frances."</p>

<p>"Try me, and see what I can do," went on Toaster
Man. "Just put a slice of that bread into my head,
and hold me over the fire."</p>

<p>Mary Frances leaned over and gravely put a slice
of bread in Toaster. He looked so funny standing
there that she wanted to smile, but thought it wouldn't
be exactly polite to so helpful a friend. But when he
said, "Slide up my collar," in a thick, smothery sort
of voice, she laughed aloud before she could stop, but
turned the sound into a cough so quickly that Toaster
Man looked up at her queerly only a moment; and
she pulled the ring up until it held the bread tightly
in place.</p>

<p>"Now, lift me up over the fire!" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mary Frances hesitated&mdash;she couldn't tell where
to take hold of him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i020b.jpg" width="324" height="227" alt="&quot;Slide up my collar.&quot;" title="" />
</div>


<p>"Never mind my legs," he said, as though he read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
her thoughts, "I'll see to them," and he folded them
up so close that when Mary Frances lifted him up, she
could find no sign of them.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/i021a.jpg" width="116" height="191" alt="She opened her book." title="" />
</div>
<p>"Oh, you'll be burnt!" she cried, as she held what
Toaster Man had called his head over the bright fire.</p>

<p>"Not I," he laughed, "not I. I like it. It's the
toast that'll be burnt, if I'm not turned over soon."</p>

<p>Mary Frances took the hint, and turned Toaster
carefully over.</p>

<p>"Not too close to the coals at first, Little Miss,"
said the little fellow. "Now,&mdash;closer! That's it!"</p>

<p>"How is it?" he asked, as Mary Frances took him
from the fire.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful piece of toast!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Grand-if-i-cent!" exclaimed Toaster. "Now, you
do the next piece without my saying a word&mdash;but
first spread that with butter, and put it in the oven.
Now, you read in your book, and see if that's not the
way to make Buttered Toast."</p>



<p>Mary Frances opened her book.</p>

<p>"Read it out!" said the little man.</p>

<p>"When I speak that way, Mother tells me to say
'Please,'" said she.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/i021b.jpg" width="402" height="194" alt="&quot;Grandificent!&quot; exclaimed Toaster." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beg pardon," said the little man, "Please."</p>

<p>So Mary Frances read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">No. 2.&mdash;Buttered Toast.</span></p>

<p>1. Spread toasted bread evenly with butter.</p>

<p>2. Pile one slice on top of the other, and cover with a bowl.</p>

<p>3. Place in oven.</p></div>

<p>"That's it! that's what I told you," cried the little
fellow. "I'm always right about toast. Can you make
the next slice without a word more?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Mary Frances; and she didn't
utter a sound until she had taken the second piece out
of Toaster.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful piece of toast!" exclaimed
Toaster. "It's better than the first."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 114px;">
<img src="images/i022a.jpg" width="114" height="290" alt="&quot;What a beautiful piece of toast!&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, I don't think&mdash;&mdash;" Mary Frances started.</p>

<p>"I know!" snapped the little man. "Don't contradict
me about toast! By the way," he asked,
"why don't you make it into Milk Toast for your
mother? it would be softer, and more palat&mdash;palat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pal-a-table," said Mary Frances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/i022b.jpg" width="263" height="131" alt="Buttered toast." title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes," said he, "you know a good deal for a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
girl,"&mdash;and he began to choke. Mary Frances patted
him hard.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/i023a.jpg" width="104" height="216" alt="Cup of milk" title="" />
</div>

<p>"A piece of toast?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," he exclaimed in-dig-nant-ly, "a long word
always makes me choke. That's why I seldom use
them. Now, please read about Milk Toast."</p>

<p>"If you know&mdash;&mdash;" sug-gest-ed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"Well, it's more like real grown-up people to have
it out of a book," said the little man. "Go on!"</p>

<p>And Mary Frances read from her little Cook
Book.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">No. 3.&mdash;Milk Toast.</span></div>


<div class="blockquot">
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="ingredients">

<tr><td align='left'>1 cup milk</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>&frac14; teaspoon salt</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3 slices toast</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>1. Make ready the toast.</p>

<p>2. Heat the milk until smoking hot.</p>

<p>3. Melt the butter in a small saucepan.</p>

<p>4. Throw the flour into the butter. Cook until it bubbles a little,
stirring all the time. Take from the fire.</p>

<p>5. Pour 1/3 the milk upon the butter and flour, a little at a time,
stirring with the back of a spoon to press out the
lumps.</p>

<p>6. Place over fire, and gradually stir in the remaining milk.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>7. Add the salt. Let boil a minute.</p>

<p>8. Put slices of toast in a heated dish; pour the sauce over and
serve hot.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All measures are made level with the top of cup or spoon. To
measure level spoonful:</p>

<p>Fill spoon heaping full, and level it off with the back of a knife.</p>

<p>For half spoonful, cut through lengthwise.</p>

<p>For quarter spoonful, divide a half spoonful across.</p>

<p>A saltspoon is 1/8 teaspoon.</p></div>

</div>

<p>"That's right!" said Toaster Man. "That's the way
my grandmother made it. If I were you, I'd make
only half of that sauce for only two slices of toast.
You did so well with the Plain Toast; you go right
ahead with the Milk Toast, and see if you can make it
all yourself, and if you need any help, I'll be on the spot
in a twinkle. Follow carefully what your little Cook
Book says. You know you must measure everything
even with the top of the spoon, or cup."</p>


<p>So Mary Frances did exactly what the recipe told
her.</p>


<p>As she poured the last of the sauce over the toast,
which she had put in a pretty dish, the little man,
who had been running here and there, watching everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
she did, shouted, "Hurrah!" At least, he tried
to shout, but his voice would scarcely reach to a grown-up
person's ear. "You are the best pupil I ever had!"</p>

<img src="images/i025a.jpg" width="108" height="284" alt="&quot;Everything falls out backwards&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Have you had many?" asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"You are the only one," said Toaster. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"I should think," said the little man, standing on
his toes, to look over the edge of the dish, "that that
Milk Toast would taste awful good!"</p>

<p>"Won't you try it?" asked Mary Frances. She
was very much afraid he would, but she wanted to
show her gratitude for his kindness.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sighed the little man, "I never eat."</p>

<p>"You never eat!" exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"It may seem strange to you," said the little man,
"but everything that is put into my head falls out
backwards, and I simply can't eat."</p>


<p>"It must be dreadful!" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"It keeps me very thin," complained Toaster,
"but if I'm not mistaken, your mother will eat all
that toast,&mdash;if she gets it while it's hot."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so," said Mary Frances; "and I thank
you so very very much."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MARY FRANCES' MOTHER</div>


<div class='cap'>MARY FRANCES pushed open the door of

<p>"What has my little girl there?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you awake, Mother? It's a s'prise for
you," and she carried the tray over to the bed.</p>

<p>Her mother carefully lifted the lid of the dish.</p>

<p>"Milk Toast! the only thing I could eat! why&mdash;who
made it?"</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Toaster, it couldn't have been
made," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>Her mother looked at the little girl in surprise.</p>

<p>"I mean," she added, "that Toaster really did it&mdash;he
showed me how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

</div>
<p>"Oh!" laughed her mother, as she lifted a slice of
toast out on a saucer. "Well, dear, anyway I want you
to have some toast with Mother"&mdash;and she handed the
saucer to Mary Frances, who said she would much
rather watch her mother eat it than to have some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
herself; but, after her first taste, she found how hungry
she was.</p>

<p>"It's the best toast I ever ate," said her mother,
"and Mary Frances, dear, I feel much better already."</p>

<p>She would have said more had not Mary Frances'
brother bounded up the stairs two steps at a time
with,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think! I met Father downtown, and
he says Aunt Maria's coming over to keep house for us.
In the daytime, she must be at home; but she'll come
over to get breakfast for us, and we'll go there for our
dinners&mdash;and Father says Mother is going to the
seashore to have a 'perfect rest' until she's well. Anyhow,
I'm glad we won't starve. I wish Sis knew how
to cook!" and he teasingly pulled one of Mary Frances'
curls.</p>

<p>"Hush, Brother!" said the mother, "you should
have been here to see the lovely Milk Toast Sister just
brought me. It was the best I ever ate&mdash;and she made
it all herself."</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">

<p>"Almost!" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said her mother, "the dear little girlie

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Brother, and Mary Frances,

<p>Instead, "When does Aunt Maria come?" she
asked. "Does she come to-night?"</p>

<p>"She's coming right over," answered her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" thought Mary Frances, "I must warn
the Kitchen People."</p>

<p>"Brother," she began, nervously, "you stay with
Mother&mdash;I want to take these things down."</p>

<p>But Brother was already sitting quietly near
Mother, and Mary Frances hurried softly downstairs.</p>

<p>"The poor dears! The poor dears!" she kept
whispering all the way down.</p>

</div>

<div class='cap'>TO the kitchen door she ran, and was about to
rush out, when she thought she heard voices&mdash;thin,
little voices they were&mdash;so she peeped out,
for the door was ajar,&mdash;and this is what she saw:</div>

<p>Toaster Man, all tired out, was leaning back in a
chair, snoring softly; but all the other Kitchen People
were wide awake. It was Tea Kettle that was speaking:</p>

<p>"So, he put the eight feathers in a pan, and cooked
them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who did?" asked Sauce Pan.</p>

<p>"The Jack Rabbit&mdash;and then he ate their fringe all
off, and gave the bones to the cat. Then he bragged&mdash;he
bragged that he'd eaten eight whole chickens at
once."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Sauce Pan.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tea Kettle.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Sauce Pan. "Was that his recipe
for Fried Chicken?"</p>

<p>"My, I'd love to hear more about the Jack Rabbit,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thought Mary Frances, "but I must warn them about
Aunt Maria"; and she hurried out into the kitchen.</p>


<p>"Listen!" she whispered, with upraised finger.
"Listen!&mdash;Mother is going away, and Aunt Maria's
coming over to keep house. Don't ever say a word&mdash;she'll
never understand you, and she'll scrub and scour
you till you ache, poor things!&mdash;she'll do that anyway,
but don't talk before her. I hurried down to warn
you&mdash;I was so afraid you might."</p>

<p>"Never fear," spoke up Tea Kettle; "we never,
never talk before 'grown-ups'&mdash;we can't help them.
I forgot to tell you&mdash;if you speak about us to anyone,
we can never, never speak again."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mary Frances, "it's a secret! I'm so
glad you told me&mdash;I came so near telling Mother about
Toaster Man&mdash;I might have, only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the door-bell rang.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AUNT MARIA</div>


<div class='cap'>"FOR the land's sakes!" cried Aunt Maria.
"For the land's sakes! Where in the world
has that child been? Look at those hands!
Have you been playing in the coal?"</div>

</div>
<p>"I put coal on the fire," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll take a look at that fire, myself," Aunt
Maria continued, as she started toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>Just then, she caught sight of the tray which Mary
Frances had brought downstairs.</p>

<p>"Milk Toast," she sniffed. "Who sent that in?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I made it," Mary Frances began.</p>

<p>There was one tiny piece left. Aunt Maria looked
at it hard.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," she said, "wonderful; who showed
you how?"</p>

<p>"Who showed you how?" she demanded, as Mary
Frances stood silent.</p>


<p>"N-no-body,&mdash;at least, no real person. I read about
how to make it in my cook book."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"No," said Mary Frances, "I mean my cook book
Mother's been making for me. I'll show it to you,"
and she ran to get it. "See!&mdash;in Mother's writing&mdash;'Mary
Frances' First Cook Book!'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Maria, "you may turn out of
some account, after all. It's about time to call for a
ref-or-ma-tion."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Mary Frances, not un-der-stand-ing
the big word&mdash;"do you want me to call for
it now?"</p>

<p>"Don't be saucy!" snapped the old lady.</p>

<p>Then she set about washing the little girl's hands
and face, rubbing so hard that it made the tears come,
finishing off with the towel until Mary Frances felt
her face shine.</p>

<p>"Wonder if she thinks I'm a stove," she
thought. "Maybe she'll black me some day by
mistake! I don't believe she knows how old I
am&mdash;she treats me like a baby, for all the world
sometimes, yet she thinks I ought to know more.
Queer!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>While Aunt Maria was busy getting dinner, she
ran up to her mother's room.</p>

<p>"Mother," she asked, "Aunt Maria will be gone
home most of the day time, while you're away, won't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Mother; "you and Brother are
to go to her house to lunch."</p>

<p>"Mother, dear," begged Mary Frances, "can't I
get lunch for Brother and me? I was going to tell you
I read&mdash;I found the recipe for the Milk Toast in my
little cook book you've been making for me. I came
up and found it while you were asleep&mdash;I just know I
can get our lunches. Please, Mother, can't I try?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear," said Mother, smiling, "I really believe
you may. I've just been thinking about the toast,
and what a woman my dear little girl is."</p>

<p>Just then Aunt Maria called:</p>

<div class='center'>
"Dinner!"<br />

</div>
<div class='cap'>"GOOD-BYE, Billy! Take good care of Sister.
Good-bye, little Housekeeper!" said Mother,
leaning from the car window. The children
waved "good-bye," and watched the train until it was
a speck in the distance.</div>




<p>"I'm off to the mill-race, with the boys, Sister,&mdash;catch!"
cried Billy, tossing Mary Frances the key.</p>

<p>"All right," she called, "be sure to come home to
lunch&mdash;twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>Mary Frances suddenly felt very lonesome.</p>

<p>"But I'll go home to my Kitchen Folks&mdash;they'll be
good company," she thought.</p>

<p>When she let herself into the house, how big and
empty it seemed! She was almost afraid to go in, but
she bravely locked the door behind her.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">

</div>

<p>She thought she heard a noise. Surely the curtain
moved! Her heart went pit-a-pat! The curtain moved
again. Out sprang Jubey, and scampered off into the
kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you darling kitten!" she cried, running after
her. "How you scared me, Jubey!"</p>

<img src="images/i037a.jpg" width="135" height="652" alt="&quot;How you scared me, Jubey!&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>Everything was as neat as a pin. All the
Kitchen Folks were in their places, prim, and quiet,
and scared, just as Aunt Maria had left them, but
when they saw her they brightened up, and smiled a
welcome.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Kitchen Folks?" she said.</p>

<p>"How do, little Miss?" merrily sang Tea Kettle.</p>

<p>"H-o-w d-o?" ticked Mantel Clock.</p>

<p>"What in the world shall I have for lunch?" mused
the little girl. "That boy will be as hungry as two
bears,&mdash;and I don't know many things to cook yet.
Toast is all right for a sick person, but it isn't much
for a hungry boy,&mdash;and I ought to make something new.
Let me see what my little book says," and she fetched
it out of its hiding place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/i037b.jpg" width="366" height="222" alt="As hungry as two bears." title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, I know! I'll make everything! I do hope
I get through the book before Mother comes back!
Let's see,&mdash;here's 'How to Cook Potatoes,' and 'Eggs';
here are 'Biscuits,' and even how to make 'Tarts' and
'Cakes,'&mdash;and Goody! Candy! Oh, how I'd love to
make candy right away, but Mother said I must make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

<p>3. Drain; cover with boiling water; add 1 tablespoon salt.</p>

<p>4. Let boil about 35 minutes, or until a fork will easily pierce the
largest.</p>

<p>5. Drain off all the water, and set pan at back of stove to dry
off the potatoes.</p>

<p>6. Serve in their jackets.</p></div>

</div>

<p>"I wonder how many Billy will eat," she thought, as
she brought the basket. "I guess about&mdash;about&mdash;I
don't know. He has an e-nor-mous appetite. I guess
I'll cook a hundred."</p>

<p>"He'll never eat a hundred!"</p>

<img src="images/i038b.jpg" width="305" height="199" alt="&quot;He&#39;ll never eat a hundred.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mary Frances looked around. Boiler Pan was
climbing down from the closet shelf.</p>

<p>"Hello! How do you know?" asked Mary Frances.
"You never saw him eat."</p>

<p>"Hear that! Hear that!" cried Boiler Pan. "As
though I hadn't cooked potatoes before you were born.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Eat a hundred? Why, I can't hold a hundred&mdash;so
there!"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" said Mary Frances, "that must be so.
How many can you hold?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about thirty, I guess," swelling with pride.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mary Frances, "you've no notion how
many that boy can eat, and there isn't much else for
lunch. I guess I'll cook about twelve,"&mdash;and counting
them out, she began to wash them.</p>

<p>"Be sure to get all the sand out of their eyes,"
laughed Boiler Pan. "But first, will you help me
jump up on the stove, and fill me?&mdash;then I can boil
while you're 'ringing' the potatoes."</p>

<p>This done, he was very quiet, while she finished the
potatoes.</p>

<p>Just then the clock struck eleven.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/i039a.jpg" width="122" height="275" alt="The clock struck eleven." title="" />
</div>

<p>"Why, I must hurry," exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," bubbled Boiler Pan.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm coming," and she dropped the
potatoes in one by one.</p>

<p>"Now, put on my hat," said Boiler Pan, and Mary
Frances put on the lid.</p>

<p>"Are they all right?" asked the little girl.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 251px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!" he answered in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>Mary Frances then went in the dining-room, and
busied herself about setting the table.</p>

<p>Soon, she heard a "rumpus" in the kitchen. She
ran out. Bubbles were sputtering over the sides of
Boiler Pan, and the lid was dancing a jig.</p>

<p>"What shall I do? What shall I do?" cried Mary
Frances, jumping up and down.</p>

<p>"This hat's crazy! Take it off, quick!" Boiler
Pan besought her.</p>

<p>Without thinking, she seized the lid with her
fingers, but dropped it with a cry of pain.</p>

<p>"I'm scalded, I'm scalded," she sobbed.
"What will I do for it?" and she ran for some cold
water.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin.
"Butter it and then powder it with baking soda the
way your mother does."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/i040a.jpg" width="93" height="393" alt="&quot;Don&#39;t do that child.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Boiler Pan, "but I really
couldn't get my old hat off. I should have told you
to take a holder."</p>


<p>"Never mind, it's better now. Those potatoes must
be done. Yes," as she tried them with a fork, "even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the biggest is done in the middle. I'm so glad, for I
expect that boy any minute."</p>

<p>"So'm I," said Boiler Pan, "for I feel the effect of
this stren-u-os-i-ty."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/i040b.jpg" width="303" height="222" alt="&quot;This hat&#39;s crazy!&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mary Frances pretended not to notice this
speech, but carefully drained the water from the
potatoes, and shook Boiler Pan over the fire to dry
them off.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;learned&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;wor&mdash;word&mdash;after
year&mdash;years&mdash;of&mdash;stud&mdash;study," he said between the
shakes, "and you&mdash;nev&mdash;never&mdash;notic&mdash;noticed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Billy was knocking.</p>

<p>So Mary Frances, hastily putting Boiler Pan on the
back of the stove, ran to let him in.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sister! Here we are! Lunch ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all ready. I'll put it on. You sit in Father's
place, and we'll play we're grown up."</p>

<p>"Scrumptious!" exclaimed Billy, as Mary Frances
set the smoking dish of potatoes on the table.</p>

<p>"What an excellent cook you must have, Madam,"
he said, after his first taste. "Such good potatoes!"</p>

<p>"I have ten," said Mary Frances.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 287px;">

Billy, for all the world as though he were a grown-up
young gentleman. "How quiet they keep."</p>

</div>

<p>"Yes," laughed Mary Frances, "but they're 'most
always busy," and she held up her ten pink little fingers.</p>


<p>"Oh, Billy," she added earnestly, "I'm so glad
you like them&mdash;the potatoes, I mean. There is only
one left&mdash;won't you have that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let's give that to Jubey&mdash;Jubey might be
hurt if you didn't let her try them. I would,&mdash;if I
were Jubey."</p>

<div class='cap'>"GOOD morning, Kitchen People," said Mary
Frances, after breakfast next day, "this is
a very important morning with me."</div>

<p>The Kitchen People looked pleased and important,
too.</p>


<p>"You see, it's this way," she continued as she took
her little book and sat in the rocking chair. "I am
very anxious to get through every recipe in my cook
book before Mother comes home, so I guess we'll just
finish all the potato recipes to-day,&mdash;and give Billy a
Potato Lunch! Won't that be fine?"</p>

<p>The Kitchen People all smiled in approval.</p>

<p>She went to the window.</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h, Billy! Billy!" she called; "you're invited
to a Potato Lunch in our dining-room at twelve

garden.</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Mary Frances to herself, "four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
more recipes&mdash;about two potatoes each. Four times
two,&mdash;eight."</p>

<p>She washed the potatoes carefully, and had no
sooner set about paring them, than the kitchen door
opened, and in walked Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"What in the world is that child doing? Paring
potatoes? Did I ever!&mdash;Such thin, close parings, too!
How well she does it!&mdash;But you must drop them into
cold water as soon as they are pared, child. I wish
I could stay and show you how to cook, but duty calls
me&mdash;I must be going!"</p>

<p>Mary Frances stepped to the door with her.</p>

<p>"When I was your age, child, I could cook 'most
everything and piece patch-work for quilts,"&mdash;and she
kept Mary Frances on the porch ten minutes, telling
her that little girls weren't brought up any more to be
useful the way they were when she was a little girl.</p>

<p>Tea Kettle, it was plain to be seen, was boiling mad.
Steam blew out of his nose in every direction.</p>

<p>Now, everybody who knows anything about a tea
kettle can imagine how very angry Tea Kettle was.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get his breath, he blew steam
all over Iron Pot.</p>

<p>"My face is black, is it? Well, yours is black,&mdash;and
it will soon be black and blue!"</p>

spout again. "Take that!"</p>

<p>Wang! came down the little fist,&mdash;but not on
the lid of Tea Kettle. Oh, no; for just as that was
going to happen, Mary Frances lifted him high in the
air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let go of me! Let me at Iron Pot!" He was at
white heat.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" said Mary Frances, shaking him quite
hard. "What's all this about?"</p>

<p>"Iron Pot commenced it!" sullenly simmered
Tea Kettle. "Iron Pot called me names!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Mary Frances, "this is disgraceful!
Now, you sit there!" She put Tea Kettle on the front
of the stove.</p>

<p>"And you, there!" She pulled Big Iron Pot as far
back as she could.</p>

<p>"Now, behave yourselves!"</p>

<p>Then she sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"What makes them quarrel so, I wonder," Mary
Frances said half to herself. "All the Kitchen People
seem so kind and helpful."</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know, child?" asked Aunty
Rolling Pin. "I thought everybody knew that
story."</p>



<p>A story! Mary Frances was always ready to listen
to a story.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me, please?"</p>

<p>Aunty Rolling Pin cleared her voice, and rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
back an inch or two to a more comfortable place on the
table.</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way, child," she began.</p>

<p>"In the days of your great-grandmother there were
no stoves, only open fireplaces were used for cooking,&mdash;and
kettles were just as black then as that old black
Pot there.</p>



<p>"So, when the Pot called the Kettle black, the
Kettle said:</p>

<p>"'Black yourself!' and no harm was done.</p>

<p>"But when your mother got that fine new cook
stove, she bought that bright, shiny Kettle, too.</p>

<p>"But that silly old Pot doesn't know that the new
Kettle is bright and shiny, so it keeps on calling names.
That Pot doesn't know it's fooling itself,&mdash;for all it
sees is its own homely old black self in the shiny Kettle
making faces.</p>

<p>"And that's what comes of calling names, child,"
chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin, as she ended her story.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Tea Kettle puffed steam importantly,
and clapped his little lid.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said in the kitchen for several
seconds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you!" at length said Mary Frances gratefully
to Aunty Rolling Pin.</p>

<p>Then she added, very firmly and gently to Iron
Pot and Tea Kettle:</p>

<p>"I want you to promise me never to call names
again, either one of you, for it makes me feel so sad.</p>

<p>"Do you promise?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I promise," brightly answered Tea Kettle.</p>

<p>"I pro-promise," solemnly declared Big Iron Pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how to cook boiled potatoes! They're
just like jacket-boiled, only they have their jackets
off," she cried.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," exclaimed Boiler Pan, which
she had put on the stove half full of water, "I
know my part&mdash;I just hurry them right along in a
jiffy."</p>



<p>He looked so interested that Mary Frances laughed
as she dropped the potatoes in.</p>

<p>"Are they all to be boi&mdash;boiled?" stuttered the
bubbling Boiler Pan.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary Frances, "all except those I
put in the oven. Listen! I'll tell you the menu for
Billy's Potato Lunch. We'll begin, of course, with
soup&mdash;Potato Soup."</p>

<p>"'Pur&eacute;e' is the word for thick soups," suggested
Boiler Pan. "It seems more stylish, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Mary Frances. "I do believe
I'll write a card for each of us to have at our places at
the table!" and she quickly brought her school pad
from her desk.</p>

<p>"That 'Potato-in-the-Shell' sounds 'swell,'" said
Coffee Pot, "but it seems to me you ought to have
something to drink, like coffee, or something of that
kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's true," Mary Frances replied, "but I
don't know how to make coffee, and Mother said I
must make everything in the order it came in my
book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't you look to see if my turn doesn't come
soon?" interrupted Coffee Pot.</p>

"To-day we have milk.</p>

<p>"Why, to-morrow!" as she looked in her book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"Isn't that fine! But&mdash;those potatoes must be done.
I should think so! A minute more, and they'd
have been burned!" she said as she drained off the
water.</p>

<p>"Now, ready for the masher!"</p>

<p>"Quite ready," said a little voice, and Mary Frances
was not surprised to see Potato Masher tumble over the
edge of Boiler Pan as she put him on the table.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 95px;">
<img src="images/i055a.jpg" width="95" height="171" alt="&quot;Quite ready.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Push my head down hard!" said he in a thick,
mushy voice, and Mary Frances did as he directed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Potato Masher stopped work.</p>

<p>"How will you know how much potato to put into
the soup?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why," said Mary Frances, "there were only six
boiled ones altogether, so the three for the soup will
be just half."</p>

<p>"Pretty good, pretty good for a little girl just learning
to cook," Potato Masher said, and ducked his
head into the potatoes again.</p>

<p>When they were finished Mary Frances said:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i055b.jpg" width="420" height="200" alt="&quot;Push my head down hard&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"You know so much about potatoes, perhaps you
can sit right up on that box," pointing to the sugar
box, "and tell me when I make a mistake. I'm going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to do 'xactly as my book says&mdash;you cry out, 'Stop!'
when I do anything the wrong way."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;will&mdash;be&mdash;the&mdash;day&mdash;of&mdash;my&mdash;life&mdash;ever&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;remembered&mdash;"</p>

<p>Potato Masher ran his words together clumsily&mdash;"But
I should be very much obliged to you if you would
first wash my face."</p>

<img src="images/i056a.jpg" width="107" height="228" alt="&quot;First wash my face.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Why, certainly," said Mary Frances. "I didn't
like to suggest it."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Miss. 'Tis a pleasure to serve
you," said the little fellow, as he perched himself on
the sugar box, when Mary Frances brought him back
to the table.</p>

<p>"All ready?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"Class proceed!" said Potato Masher, with a school
teacher air.</p>

<p>Only twice did he interrupt her as she followed
every direction given in the recipes: once, to remind
her of the potatoes in the oven; and again, to tell
her to pour the soup very slowly, lest she burn
herself.</p>

<p>"It's mag-nif-i-cent!&mdash;this Potato Lunch," said he,
as Mary Frances carried the last smoking dish to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
dining table. "'Tis a proud day for the 'Assistant
Chef'&mdash;meaning myself."</p>

<p>He made a pompous little bow toward the Kitchen
Folks.</p>

<p>"I little thought she'd be on time. I was afraid
I'd have to strike before she was ready," declared
Mantel Clock, beginning to strike twelve just as Billy
came in.</p>

<p>"Menus!" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>"Jimminy! 'Billy's Potato Lunch,'" he read.
"Oh, I say&mdash;if I'd known I'd have dressed for the
occasion!"</p>

<p>"Don't make fun, Billy," begged Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"'Make fun,'" cried Billy. "Just taste that
soup&mdash;and see if anyone could make fun. It's fit for
the President."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Billy!" Mary Frances laughed.</p>

<p>"Maybe you think I don't mean it," said Billy,
helping himself to mashed potatoes. "Why didn't you
invite some company?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that Potato Masher&mdash;I mean, I
didn't know it would turn out so well," blushed Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," said Billy "I 'most forgot!
Aunt Maria had word her brother is sick at Upland, and
she went to see him this morning, and can't possibly
be back in time for breakfast. I guessed we'd make

<div class='cap'>MARY FRANCES was a long time getting to
sleep that night for thinking about breakfast.</div>

<p>She had her little cook book, and Mother's last
letter under her pillow.</p>

<p>"Billy writes your lunches are 'scrumptious,'" ran
her mother's letter. "I cannot tell how much comfort
my little girl is to me."</p>


<p>"I've 'most a mind to tell Mother about the cook
book," thought Mary Frances, "but won't she open
her eyes when I tell her I've made everything&mdash;if I
can keep the secret! I do hope I wake up in time.
Father said he'd call me to breakfast, when he said
"Good-night," but I want to slip down, and have
everything ready when he comes."</p>

<p>So she fell asleep, and dreamed she made an Angel
Cake as big as a mountain, and that Jubey stole it, and
fed all the hungry cats in the World.</p>

</div>

<p>She had fixed the curtain so that the first sunlight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
would fall on her face, and it seemed only a breath of
time until she felt it call her.</p>

<p>How sleepy she was!</p>

<p>"I'll get down before the Kitchen Folks are awake,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>She carried her little shoes in her hand and stole
softly downstairs, stopping in the dining-room to put
them on.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you!" she recognized the voice of Tea
Kettle.</p>

<p>"Just wait till I read it out of my little book,"
mimicked a new voice.</p>

</div>
<p>"For shame, you saucy Pan!" exclaimed Big Iron Pot.</p>

<p>"Just wait until I read it!"</p>

<p>Mary Frances peeped into the kitchen. In the
middle of the floor stood little Sauce Pan, pretending to
read out of a book:</p>

<p>"'How to Make Potato Pie Out of Sauer-kraut.'"</p>

<p>"Silly!" exclaimed Potato Masher.</p>

<p>Sauce Pan repeated:</p>

<p>"To Make Potato Pie Out of Sauer-kraut:</p>

<p>"1. Fill eight potatoes with Sauer-kraut, and peel
them.</p>

<p>"2. Make a crust of the left-overs.</p>

<p>"3. Bake the parings well, and serve very hot on ice."</p>

<p>Just then Mary Frances sneezed.</p>

<p>How Sauce Pan ran, and jumped up to his place
on the rack!</p>

<p>He looked so shamefaced when Mary Frances went
in, that she hadn't the heart to scold him.</p>

<p>Instead, "Boiled Eggs," she called.</p>

<p>He pretended to be asleep. Then she took him by
the arm and shook him.</p>

<p>"Boiled Eggs!" she shouted. "Doesn't that
mean you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," he said meekly; "I'm such a
'sleepy-head!' Do you know," con-fi-den-ti-al-ly, "I
often talk in my sleep." At this the Kitchen People
grinned.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said Mary Frances, "It's a dangerous
habit. Sometimes people tell stories when they're
awake, too," she added as she stepped out to get the
milk.</p>

<p>"Is 'Old Puff-away' ready?" asked Sauce Pan of
Coffee Pot.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 434px;">

<p>"If you mean Tea Kettle, Saucy," answered Coffee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Pot excitedly, "I hope so, for I can scarcely wait till
I'm needed."</p>

<p>Tea Kettle gave two extra puffs of steam, but otherwise
took no notice.</p>

<p>"How do you know you'll be used?" Sauce Pan
asked of Coffee Pot, nudging Pie Plate who was near him.</p>

<p>"I come next in the book&mdash;and, besides, I'm always
used for breakfast." Coffee Pot was beginning to
get angry.</p>

<p>"Bet we have eggs,&mdash;eggs, and toast, and&mdash;<i>tea!</i>
Yes, I bet it's <i>tea</i> for B. this morning."</p>

<p>Sauce Pan kept on saying, "Tea for B." so long
that Coffee Pot began to cry:</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with Coffee Pot?" Mary
Frances asked when she came in. "Is it possible
Aunt Maria forgot to dry you last night?"</p>

<p>Nobody said anything&mdash;and Sauce Pan hastily
ran toward the stove.</p>

<p>"Wait," called Mary Frances, "wait a minute until
I can look in my book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can say it without any book&mdash;we all know
our own tricks," boasted Sauce Pan.</p>

<p>"All right," said Mary Frances, "say it&mdash;that will
save time."</p>

<p>So he began.</p>

<p>"B'iled eggs&mdash;excuse me!&mdash;boiled eggs," he corrected,
seeing Mary Frances' stern face.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">No. 9.&mdash;Boiled Eggs.</span></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Put eggs in sauce pan.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Mary Frances, "I thought you
dropped the eggs into boiling water for three minutes
or more, 'accordin'&mdash;that's what Nora said. I asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
her what 'accordin' meant, and she said 'accordin'
to the tastes of them that eats them&mdash;soft or hard."</p>

<p>"I was speaking of the best way," declared Sauce
Pan glancing loftily at Mary Frances. "There is
no end of ways to do it, but this is the scientific way
to cook eggs so that they will be soft, but cooked all the
way through and easily digested&mdash;not liquid inside
a hard, white coat. In other Words&mdash;Ahem! the
al-bu-men (white of egg) cooks much better at a lower
than a higher temperature."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Coffee Pot.</p>

<p>"I wonder how it is in my book." Mary Frances
turned to the page. "Exactly as you said!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course!" declared Sauce Pan.</p>

Pot to Toaster.</p>

to pour out the hot water. "Tea Kettle is
my right-hand man. Don't you dare say another
word until I speak to you"&mdash;as she put in the eggs,
and drew him to the back of the stove.</p>

<p>"And now, I'll make the coffee."</p>

<p>At her side stood Coffee Pot.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite ready," she said.</p>

<p>"You might pour out the first cupful to clear the

</div>
<p>"Thank you, Coffee Pot," smiled Mary Frances,
in praise, "how interested and wide awake you are!"</p>

<p>"I never sleep much," confided Coffee Pot. "I
believe it's the coffee&mdash;just 'cat naps,' you know.
I sometimes think my heart is affected&mdash;I'm so easily
stirred up,&mdash;although I always feel well."</p>



<p>"If you always feel well," laughed Mary Frances,
"I guess your heart is all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," giggled Sauce Pan, "he's awfully good-hearted."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you,&mdash;'not another word' until I
spoke to you?" said Mary Frances to Sauce Pan, as
she lifted Coffee Pot to the table, and measured out
the coffee and water.</p>

<p>After she had followed his directions entirely, she
made the toast.</p>

<p>Toaster Man was so sleepy, he didn't say a word
except, "You'll do it right, I know," and fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>Just then, Mary Frances heard her father call.</p>

<p>"A kiss and a bear hug," laughed Mary Frances,
throwing her arms around him as he lifted her up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brother," said Mary Frances, kissing Billy;

<p>She flew into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Such a place! So thick with smoke and steam that
all the Kitchen People were coughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! dear!" cried Mary Frances, the tears

Sauce Pan with a sob.</p>

<p>"You told me not to speak until you spoke to
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was asleep," interrupted Toaster.</p>

<p>"Who are you talking to, Mary Frances?" asked
her father. "Aren't you nearly ready?"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;sh!" Warned Mary Frances, with uplifted
finger&mdash;then aloud:</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, I'm so disappointed! I had everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

burnt up! Oh, de&mdash;ar, oh, oh, oh, de&mdash;ar!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Honey," said her father, kissing
away her tears. "Never mind! There's no hurry this
morning, I'll fix the fire and you do it all over again."</p>

<p>"But I've wasted all the eggs&mdash;they're as hard
as bricks&mdash;they cooked twenty minutes. I forgot

appetite."</p>

<p>When they went into the kitchen Mary Frances saw
Sauce Pan whisper something to Coffee Pot, but her
father didn't notice. He quickly fixed the fire.</p>

<p>"Now, Father," begged Mary Frances, "please let

you call us when you're ready."</p>

<p>In a very few minutes she did call them, and a fine
breakfast it was, too; for Mary Frances knew <i>how</i> so
well that not a minute was wasted.</p>

<p>"Ain't she the loveliest cook," whispered Coffee
Pot to Sauce Pan, as Mary Frances disappeared
through the dining room door with the eggs.</p>

<p>When Aunt Maria and Mary Frances came into the
kitchen later, the old lady was talking.</p>

<p>"Very creditable, child," she said, looking at the
shelves, all in order, "very creditable indeed. I can't
understand it&mdash;with no one to show you how to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have my little book," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"<i>Book!</i>" sniffed Aunt Maria, putting the breakfast
cereal on to cook. "<i>Book!</i> A <i>book</i> can't tell you
exactly when a piece of toast is brown enough, or a
potato just done enough to be mealy, nor how to keep
a pan from burning. Book! It's talent! That's
what it is! Blood will tell. You inherited it from me.
I never burnt pans&mdash;never in my life&mdash;there's no excuse
for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Mary Frances, thinking of the
ruined breakfast.</p>

<p>"Go up, and open the beds to air," commanded
Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>When Mary Frances got back, she could scarcely
see across the kitchen for smoke.</p>

salts! The porridge is all burnt up! What a disgrace!"</p>

<p>Mary Frances felt very sorry for her, but when she
saw Sauce Pan and Coffee Pot holding their queer little
fists over their mouths to keep from laughing out, and
when she remembered how funny the old lady looked
making across the kitchen in two steps, she ran back
into the dining room to laugh.</p>

she'd say it, the more she'd laugh. "This is dreadful,
Mary Frances," she'd scold herself; "but, oh, my,
wasn't it funny!"&mdash;and away she'd go again.</p>

<p>At length she Went back upstairs until Aunt Maria
called,</p>

holding out a piece of sand-paper.</p>

eye!</p>

<p>Bowing, he began to recite:</p>

<p>
"Of course, you never burn your pans,<br />

<p>"I will!" exclaimed Mary Frances; and in less
than a twinkle had rubbed all the burnt spots off.</p>

<p>"My,&mdash;that's better; thank you," brightly beamed
Boiler Pan.</p>

<p>Mary Frances sat down on the rocking chair, and

beginning to boil. How awfully cold and hungry the
poor man looks!"</p>


<p>"Wait a minute," she called.</p>

<p>"I almost know how to make tea,&mdash;but I'd better
look at the recipe. Where'd I put my book? Oh,
here it is,&mdash;open to the place," she spoke softly.</p>


<p>Then she read the directions for making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

tea.</p>

<p>4. Let stand for 5 minutes in a very warm place, but do not let
it boil. Stir, and serve.</p>

<p>If not used immediately, strain into another heated pot.</p></div>

<p>Very soon she had filled the largest cup she could
find in the closet, and handed it to the tramp.</p>

<p>"That's the bonniest cup o' tea I've drank for
mony a year, Miss," said he. "It tastes like the auld
country, shure."</p>

<p>"Like the old country!" thought Mary Frances.
"That's the funniest way for anything to taste I ever
heard of. Maybe he's so hungry he's a little bit out of
his head. Oh, I know what I'll do! I'll make an omelet
for him! I don't believe he's eaten omelet since&mdash;maybe,
since he was as little as I am&mdash;maybe a hundred
years. He looks a hundred years old, I'm sure. I hope

Frances carried the smoking dish out on the porch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to him with a slice of bread and butter. "You've got a
kind heart, you 'ave, to be shure. Ain't that&mdash;whatever
it is&mdash;a beauty!"</p>

<p>"It is real pretty," said Mary Frances, feeling quite
proud. "I just made it for you. I'm learning to cook.
My mother's away&mdash;and I'm here all alone just now
except for Jubey and the Kitchen F&mdash;&mdash; (she caught
herself just in time). Jubey is the kitten, you know.
My lessons just came to Omelet, and&mdash;why, what's
the matter with it?" she cried, dismayed. "It's all

hungrily began to eat.</p>

her lesson!"</p>

<p>Going into the kitchen, he took Mary Frances on
his knee.</p>

mother's nice things, or had stolen our dear little
daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary Frances, listen, child! Never, when you
are alone, unlock the door to any man or woman you
do not know. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," said Mary Frances; "I didn't
mean to be bad."</p>

<p>"No, dear; but it would be very naughty indeed
for you to do so again. Do you promise?"</p>

on his shoulder. "I'll never, never do it again, dear

<div class='cap'>MARY FRANCES listened at the kitchen door
before going in next morning. She wanted
to find out what the Kitchen People might
be doing.</div>

<p>"It isn't exactly eavesdropping," she thought,
"although it seems awfully near to it."</p>

<p>"Can't you find it?" somebody was asking.</p>

<p>"Seems to be having trouble," said Tea Pot. "Of
course, he can't very well find out&mdash;being so short
and fat, and having no nose to speak of."</p>

<p>"Well, Nosey," answered Coffee Pot, "suppose you
try&mdash;your nose is long enough to poke into anything!"</p>

<p>"So much the better for me this time, Pug Nose."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, stop calling names, and find out&mdash;if you
can," cried Big Iron Pot.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it's my turn again!" interrupted Sauce
Pan. "Now, see if I'm not right."</p>

<p>"He's peeped already," declared Coffee Pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, say, Tea Pot, if you're any good, get to work!
See if he's right. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tea Pot rather breathlessly. (It
seemed to Mary Frances as if he were lifting a heavy
weight.) "Yes, here is the place. Somebody else read;
I'm too tired."</p>

<p>"I'll read," said Sauce Pan. "What was the last?
Oh, yes, here it is, just as I said!"</p>

Pot; "he'll make it up."</p>

him bowing.) "Allow me to call your attention to

Sauce Pan quite carelessly. "He needs a lesson, and
I don't need his help," she thought. "I'll treat him
quite in-dif-fer-ent-ly."</p>

<p>"The salmon ought to have been opened an hour

helper could be, but could discover no one.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked, more to find out
who was speaking than to gain information.</p>

sharp it was little more than a squeak. "I'm Can

"I'm glad to see you. Now, why open the salmon an

two before needed, and turned out," explained Can
Opener, "to get well aired."</p>

Apples out of the oven, before answering. It was Billy
with Robert and Eleanor who lived down the street.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sister," said Billy, "I told you I'd bring
company home to lunch some day. Anything ready?"</p>

Billy did the same for Robert.</p>

Mary Frances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PATENT DISH-WASHING</div>
<div class='cap'>"OH, my!" sighed Mary Frances, gazing at the
great pile of dirty dishes on the kitchen
table, where she had carried them after
the company had gone. "Oh, my, cooking is fun&mdash;but
washing dishes is another thing. I'm 'most tired
enough to drop,&mdash;and there must be a hundred dishes
to do! I'm glad Tea Kettle is full of hot water."</div>

</div>

<p>"Bubble! Bubble! Piff! Piff!" puffed Tea Kettle,
mys-ter-i-ous-ly smiling as though he knew something
was about to happen.</p>

<p>Mary Frances couldn't see anything very pleasing
with so much of a task before her.</p>

<p>She put the large dish pan on the table and poured
in the water, whirling the soap around in it several
times to make it a little sudsy.</p>

<p>Then she sat down to rest.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/i095a.jpg" width="98" height="369" alt="dishes" title="" />
</div>
<p>"Really, I didn't know I was so tired," she thought;
"maybe my age is telling on me the way Aunt Maria
says!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Her weary little head began to nod, and she was soon
fast asleep. She hadn't been asleep long before she
was aroused by a great racket.</p>

<p>"Click, clack! Click-ety-clack! Splash!"</p>

<p>"Come," she said to herself, rather sharply, "I do
believe you've been asleep, Mary Frances! You'd
better get to work, child."</p>

<p>"Click! Clack!"</p>

<p>Again came the sound.</p>

<p>With her sleepy lids half open she glanced toward
the table, and such a sight she never saw! She sat up
with mouth and eyes wide open, but nobody paid any
attention to her.</p>

<p>There were the dishes jumping higgledy-piggledy,
pell-mell into the dish pan.</p>

<p>First a cup, followed by a saucer, then a spoon,
followed by a fork.</p>

<p>"Make room for me," cried Platter, diving in
head first.</p>

<p>"Look out, or you'll chip me," cried Tea Cup,
tumbling out on the other side of the pan.</p>

<p>"I'm next!" a big dinner plate splashed in "kerplunk."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 461px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Frances couldn't say a word&mdash;she was so
afraid they might break their heads.</p>

<p>"Ouw! this is hot!" screamed Little Pitcher.</p>

<p>All the other Kitchen People were looking on and
laughing. Aunty Rolling Pin was rocking to and fro,
laughing so hard the tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>When Yellow Bowl bounced into the water, "Chase
yourself!" cried Soup Ladle, making hard after.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell, the dishes were all
clean, and had piled themselves up neatly on the table.</p>

<p>Then Mary Frances realized what had happened.</p>

<p>"That was a patent dish-washing," she said. "I
don't want you to do that often. I was afraid my
mother's china would be broken all to pieces! But
I am very much obliged, this time, I'm sure."</p>

<div class='cap'>MARY FRANCES carried all her dolls to the
window seat in her room, and placed them
in a row. Then she held up an envelope.</div>

</div>
<p>"Misses Angelina, Marie, Cosette, Lady Gay, Peg,
Master Alfonso, why, listen! Here's a letter come for
you. What can it be? Pay very strict 'tention
while I read it. If you'd gone to school every day
I've been so busy, perhaps you could read it yourselves;
but, of course, when my hands are so full, I
can't possibly get you off, and you are so helpless.
Aren't you 'shamed? I think&mdash;yes, I think you all
look ashamed except Peg. If you don't look ashamed
in one minute, Peg,&mdash;just one minute I'll give you,&mdash;you
sha'n't hear this! There, that will do! You
needn't cry, dear child! Now, I'll read."</p>
<p>Mary Frances cut open the envelope.</p>

<p>Every doll looked deeply interested except poor Peg
who had fallen on her side. "Why, it's an invitation
to a Dolls' Party! Listen!"</p>

</div>

<p>"Now, dears," Mary Frances smiled upon them,
"no wonder you look surprised; for that's a grand
invitation, all written out on real paper. I had an
awful time getting it to sound right. I'm not sure that
it is just exactly correct yet. So we'll get dressed
right away. Now don't all ask at once what you'll
wear. Yes, Fonsey, of course you'll wear your dress
suit. What of it if it isn't proper to wear it until after
six o'clock? You have only your work clothes and that
suit and you'll have to wear your best."</p>

<p>Everybody was quiet and good as gold while Mary
Frances finished dressing them.</p>


<p>"There," she said to herself, "the last sash is tied.
Goodness, I'm tired&mdash;tired-er than if I'd been cooking
the whole morning! Aren't dolls stupid compared
with Kitchen Folks? I do wonder what the Kitchen
Folks will do. Will they talk before them?"</p>

<p>"Did you, or did you not, please," asked Aunty

<p>"Ever make any biscuits, child?"</p>

<p>"No, Aunty Rolling Pin, but I believe I can with
your help, if you'll be so kind."</p>

<p>"'Deed I will, child." Aunty Rolling Pin gave a
delighted chuckle. "I've been waiting patiently for
the chance."</p>

<p>"I'm going to give a Dolls' Kitchen Party, Aunty."</p>

everything more important than ever. So, as you
gather together the things you'll need, you can listen&mdash;ahem!&mdash;to
Aunty Rolling Pin's Wisdom."</p>

<p>"You know about 'most everything!" said Mary
Frances. "I'd be much obliged to you for any other

<p>"Mother expected to explain everything to me, you
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, child," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin, seeing
Mary Frances looked sad; "but I see you have sifted
the flour and baking powder and salt into a bowl and
poured it back. Instead of using a bowl, it's a good
idea to use a piece of heavy paper. When this is
folded funnel-like, the flour can readily be poured into
the sifter again and again."</p>

<p>"That certainly is easier," said Mary Frances,
putting the hint to practice.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/i102a.jpg" width="119" height="531" alt="&quot;Poured into the sifter again and again&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"In order to get the baking powder into every bit
of the flour, they should be sifted together three times.
Now, I see you are working the butter into the flour.
Rub lightly with your finger tips. That's it&mdash;pour
the milk gradually, mix well&mdash;the dough should be
almost sticky, but not too soft to handle. Now it's
my turn," she chuckled, as Mary Frances turned the
dough on a well-floured board. "But if you are going
to make Thimble Biscuits, one half of the dough is
enough to pat out for them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I can make the rest into real biscuits! What
a splendid idea!" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the handles are her ears," she thought,
softly patting the dough with Aunty Rolling Pin.</p>

<p>As she bent over, she caught the sound of singing,
and this is the song Aunty Rolling Pin sang:</p>

"Roly-poly, roly-poly,<br />

<p>"Where?" she asked suddenly stopping.</p>

<p>Mary Frances jumped. She had been rolling Aunty
Rolling Pin to and fro, unconsciously keeping time with
her song.</p>

<p>"Where?" she again demanded, her mouth full
of flour.</p>

<p>"Dear me," answered Mary Frances, "I don't
know."</p>

<p>"School, of course," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin;
"I thought you'd surely know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," laughed Mary Frances;
"Cooking School."</p>

<p>"Certainly, child," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin.
"To what other school could you go to learn about
me?"</p>

<p>"That's beautiful poetry," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"I think so," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin; "I made
it up myself. It's so <i>floury</i>, you know," blowing the
white dust in the air.</p>

<p>"Tee-hee," giggled Mary Frances.</p>

<p>Aunty Rolling Pin looked offended.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Mary Frances, "you mean
'flowery.'"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," said Aunty Rolling Pin;
"isn't that what I said?"</p>

<p>As it certainly was what she said, and Mary Frances
didn't like to explain, she hastily turned to her work.</p>

<p>It didn't take long to cut the biscuits, as she had
often helped her mother in baking. She knew how
to dip the cutter each time into flour, that the dough
might not stick. She used the large thimble she had
brought down from the sewing room in the same way
as she had used the biscuit cutter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 486px;">

<p>"Aren't they too sweet!" she cried delightedly,
as she laid the tiny biscuits side by side, but not touching,
in the little baking pan. With the rest of the
dough, she had made three larger ones. "One for
each of the family," she said, slipping them with the
Thimble Biscuits into the oven.</p>

<p>"Let me see what's next. Oh, yes, the cocoa.
I do declare, it's little Sauce Pan's turn again. No
wonder he's puffed up," she thought. "Strange, he
hasn't said a word. I'm 'most sure I have to use Sauce
Pan. Perhaps he doesn't understand. I'll read aloud:</p>

<p>"What 'n awful story!" exclaimed the one who had
first spoken.</p>

<p>"You're not very polite to question my word to my
very face," Sauce Pan retorted angrily. "Now, if
someone else had told you, that would have been
different; then you'd had some excuse."</p>

<p>"Come," thought Mary Frances, "that's too silly!
I'll put an end to this. I don't need any help with this
simple recipe."</p>

<p>Seizing Sauce Pan quite carelessly, she quickly
made the cocoa.</p>

Aunt Maria at the lunch table. She had
invited the children over to lunch that
day. "She needs nourishment more than anything
else, I should say. That cook she has can't make a

<p>"If only," thought Mary Frances, "if only I could
cook something for her! Wait until I look in my book.
I wonder if she could eat to-day's lesson."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud&mdash;that seemed so funny.</p>

<p>"Well," snapped Aunt Maria, "of all things; to
laugh at a poor sick neighbor in such a pre-dic-a-ment."</p>

<p>Mary Frances blushed, but she didn't say anything.</p>

<p>After lunch, she started home as soon as possible.</p>

Mary Frances had placed on the table.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty nice cut of meat&mdash;pretty nice.
It will be all right to cook it as I will tell you. But,
really, mutton is less greasy if it is boiled long enough
before needed to let the gravy cool. Take off the cake
of fat which will form on the top when cold. Of
course, take the meat out as soon as it is tender, and
after 'skimming' the gravy, put it in again to re-heat."</p>

<p>"Thank you both, my friends," said Mary Frances,
lifting Iron Pot.</p>

<p>"My, but you're heavy!"</p>

<p>"'Tis true," said Iron Pot, sadly, "all my old-fashioned
friends, like Iron Tea Kettle&mdash;glancing toward
the new Tea Kettle&mdash;and Caldron, are gone. But,"
he added, brightening up, "it has been proved that
for boiling meats, no modern 'light-weights' could 'do
them up so brown!'"</p>

<p>"We'll prove it again," laughed Mary Frances.
"I do believe I'll have a splendid lunch for Father&mdash;a
regular big man's lunch. Listen!</p>

"to-day's lesson is so easy I think it
would be just the time to invite Eleanor over for her

<p>"I do wonder whether the Kitchen People will talk

<p>"Wonder what little Mistress will cook to-day."</p>

<p>"I'll see if they know," said Mary Frances to
herself.</p>

<p>"It's hard to remember so far ahead," complained
Coffee Pot. "I wish it was my turn all the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have more chance than most of us, except
Tea Kettle," exclaimed Sauce Pan. "I expect, though,
most of us will be used a lot now,"&mdash;airily.</p>

<p>It was a new voice. Mary Frances peeped out.
Big Blue Pitcher was near the edge of the shelf.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly true, though," re-tort-ed Sauce Pan,
angrily.</p>

<p>"There! There!" said Aunty Rolling Pin, soothingly;
"don't get so excited! Of course it's true."</p>

not a word was answered.</p>

broken pieces of poor Blue Pitcher. "Won't she be sorry!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she will!" said Sauce Pan; "but it was his
own fault! I think Jubey'll be sorrier! She thought
Blue Pitcher one of her best friends. They were very
con-fi-dent-ial. Only yesterday I heard her telling
him that always after eating a hearty meal for which
she had no appetite, she felt hungry."</p>

<p>"What did Blue Pitcher say?" asked Aunty
Rolling Pin.</p>

<p>"Never paid any 'tention&mdash;just said: 'Humph,
Jubey, I know where a lot of cat-tails grow!'</p>

<p>"'You do, do you?' said Jubey. 'I'd like to know.'</p>

<p>"'On little kittens!' said Blue Pitcher."</p>

<p>The Kitchen People laughed.</p>

Coffee Pot.</p>

<p>"No," said Sauce Pan, overhearing, "I&mdash;I don't

<p>"No, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin, smiling; "but
perhaps you have learned by this time pretty nearly
well enough to do an easy lesson without our help.
We can't talk before other people, you know. Perhaps
the little girl's own Kitchen People will help her some

<p>"Well, it's a very easy lesson, I think.&mdash;'Apple

Frances' mother had written in the recipe. The
Kitchen People watched out of the corners of their eyes,
but never said a word.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't this good," sighed Eleanor, eating the
light, delicious dessert. Then, "Mary Frances, I
know; I'm going to ask my mother for a cook book!
I wonder if you'll let me borrow yours some time to
show her."</p>

<p>"Of course!" laughed Mary Frances.</p>

bundle.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, you have company, I see," said
the old lady with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Eleanor, "Mary Frances

crying. Silly old me!" and she wiped the tears from
her spectacles.</p>

<p>"Mary Frances, dear," she said, at length, "I heard
about the lovely things you made Mary Ann Hooper;
and I found out, too, by wheedlin' it out of her, about
the cooking lessons&mdash;and here's a surprise for you,"
and she handed the bundle to the little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria!" cried Mary Frances unwrapping
it. "Look, Eleanor!&mdash;a little cap and apron!"</p>

<p>"To wear at your cooking lessons," fluttered Aunt
Maria.</p>

<p>"How dear and lovely!" (Trying them on.) "Look,
Eleanor, they just fit!"</p>

Eleanor.</p>

Mary Frances; "but she's much better, and is coming
home soon. Aunt Maria," she added,&mdash;"oh, I want
you to share the secret! I'm doing all the lessons
she had written out for me in my cook book&mdash;to surprise
her when she comes home!"</p>

can get dinner ready the day she comes!"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly thinking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria, excuse me, please! Won't you
have some of our lesson?&mdash;Some of the Apple Snow we
made for our lesson, I mean?"</p>

<p>"I'd ap-pre-ci-ate the kindness," said the old lady
a little stiffly, as though a bit ashamed of her softness
a moment ago. But after tasting the treat, she said:</p>

<p>"It's the most beautiful snow I ever saw, little
girls,&mdash;even more beautiful than that on which I, so
many years ago, used to pull a sled."</p>

she says&mdash;whatever that means. Anyhow, Father's
coming. He's going to make up for the lunch he
couldn't come to. I'm so happy!"</p>

<p>"So'm I! Goody! Goody! I'm all ready!"</p>

<p>Mary Frances turned.</p>

<p>"If it isn't Basket!" she cried. "I had no idea you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I wanted to go?" asked Basket proudly.
"My family are the most important 'picnickers' at
any picnic! We always go!"</p>

<p>"Well, to be sure!" exclaimed Mary Frances.
"Here, wait&mdash;these eggs will be ready in a minute!"</p>

<p>"Tuck the napkin in carefully, please," said Basket.
"I won't spill them out. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary Frances. "Aunt Maria said I
could bring just one thing&mdash;and to surprise everybody;
so I have not told anyone what I am going to bring.
I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 112px;">

</div>

<p>But her thought was cut short by Coffee Pot's
crying excitedly: "I want to go! I want to go! I&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;go!
go! go! go! I want to go&mdash;go&mdash;go&mdash;go!&mdash;go&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't go!" said Sauce Pan. "Why&mdash;you!&mdash;you'd&mdash;you&mdash;you'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mary Frances. "I'll take
you, Coffee Pot. Maybe Aunt Maria's little coffee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

<p>Coffee Pot looked tri-umph-ant-ly at Sauce Pan,
but seemed too happy to say anything.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Kitchen People," said Mary Frances,
"I wish I could take you all."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," cried the Kitchen People; "hope
you'll have a lovely time!"</p>

<p>"I'd be scared," said Sauce Pan, glancing at Coffee
Pot. "Who knows what's in the woods?" And as
Mary Frances closed the door, he was singing:</p>

<div class='cap'>"GET scared at the 'Pic-wick,'&mdash;I mean 'Picnic,'&mdash;Coffey,"
teased Sauce Pan next morning.</div>

<p>"Nope," said Coffee Pot, "the 'airing' did
me good. I feel lots clearer."</p>



<p>"Tell us about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not good at story telling! The Aunt told
about the funniest recipe she knew,&mdash;called 'Merry
Land Biscuits,' I think. Anyhow, she said to 'beat
'em twenty minutes with an axe!'"</p>

<p>"That's a kitchen person I never heard of," said
Tea Kettle.</p>

<p>"Did the Aunt like the little Miss' cooking?"
asked Aunty Rolling Pin, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, and she talked about Mary Frances' de-vel-op-ment
of char-ac-ter&mdash;whatever that is. It seemed
to have something to do with cooking, for at the same
time, she told about the things our little Miss had
made, and seemed so proud.</p>

Frances (for our little mistress had the book tucked
under her arm). 'How far are you?' And when
Mary Frances showed her:</p>

<p>"'Candy!' she exclaimed, 'Why, to-morrow, my
dear (she never used to call her my dear), you can
have a Candy Pull&mdash;only,' she laughed, 'it isn't the
kind that is pulled.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Aunt Maria,' said Mary Frances, 'that's
the loveliest thought&mdash;the Candy Pull, I mean.'"</p>

<p>"Humph," said Sauce Pan, "I don't think so!
That means we can't help her."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it doesn't," said Aunty Rolling Pin.
"We can help her a great deal by just doing our part.
Don't you see? She doesn't need us as she used
to."</p>

<p>"Do read them, Mary Frances," said Eleanor. "I'm so

<p>"Well," said Mary Frances, "the first is 'Pickaninny

delighted.</p>

<p>Mary Frances tied on her new apron
and put on her pretty little cap.</p>

<p>"Fly time is nearly gone," said Sauce Pan, "and&mdash;school
time is almost here," he added, seeing Mary
Frances didn't seem to notice.</p>



<p>"Yes," she said, "but before school time, there's a
grand good time&mdash;Mother comes home to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mary Frances, "it doesn't seem soon
when I think of it without my cooking lessons&mdash;but
when I think I'm nearly through the book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's to-day's lesson?" asked Aunty Rolling
Pin. "I'm so anxious you do get through!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Aunty Rolling Pin, I must tell you.
I'm going to give a Tea Party!"</p>

<p>"A Tea Party!" exclaimed Tea Pot, clapping his
lid up and down. "Oh, lovely!"</p>

Frances. "We're going to have two kinds of cake,&mdash;and
cocoa!"</p>

<p>Then, seeing how disappointed Tea Pot looked:</p>

<p>"Oh, I will have tea, too. Aunt Maria without
tea! That will never do!"</p>

<p>"Now for the next recipe:</p>

<p>1. Separate yolks of eggs and beat in a large bowl.</p>

<p>2. Add gradually half the sugar, stirring well.</p>

<p>3. Add the boiling water slowly.</p>

<p>4. Add remaining sugar, and the flavoring.</p>

<p>5. Sift together twice flour, baking powder and salt.</p>

<p>6. Sift by small quantities into the mixture, beating well each
time.</p>

<p>7. Beat whites of eggs and fold them into the cake.</p>

<p>8. Grease pan. Toss around in it &frac14; cup flour. Throw out.
This prevents sticking.</p>

<p>"What's that!" a queer, muffled voice.</p>

<p>Mary Frances started in surprise.</p>

<p>A great com-mo-tion inside the pantry, and the
sound of many little voices! Then she made out the
words:</p>

<p>"Get out of my way! Here, you, step aside!"
(Then a little shriek or two followed by the sound of
falling tins.) "Oh, you knocked my nose. There!
that makes the fiftieth dent! No wonder I look old
and worn out. Can't you wait a minute?"</p>

<p>At length there came a pounding on the door, and
a high little voice&mdash;or was it two voices?</p>

<p>"Let me out! Oh, I say, please let us out!"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" thought Mary Frances, "I hope there
isn't going to be any trouble." And she cautiously
opened the pantry door a little way. The two Cake
Tins pushed their way out.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" they said, breathlessly, in chorus
(looking at each other all the while as though they'd
learned and rehearsed every word). "I thought I'd
never get out to help! I've listened through the door
to every lesson, just hoping my turn would come.
There I was back of the other pots and pans, and when
I heard 'Cake' I just jumped!"</p>

<p>"As I had just started to say"&mdash;Aunty Rolling
Pin began.</p>

<p>"What do you know about cakes!" cried the
Cake Tins, angrily. "If everybody'd just mind his
own cooking&mdash;who ever rolls cakes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know about cookies," said Aunty Rolling
Pin; "and besides, I know about most things,&mdash;I
belonged to a real cooking teacher!"</p>

<p>"Now, ladies, you can see the ex-ceed-ing-ly good
texture of this cake, as I drop it from the spoon. The
nu-tri-tive value of the ut-il-ized com-po-si-tion is
unequaled, except in rare cases of cul-in-ary e-con-om-y.

stop it!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Square Cake Tin, "I don't see
that that proves you know anything about cake. Now
I'll explain:</p>

<p>"There are really only two kinds of cake in general:</p>

<p>"1. Cakes without butter, or some form of sponge
cakes.</p>

<p>"2. Cakes with butter, or plain cakes.</p>

<p>"More important than the mixing of the cake is the
baking.</p>

<p>"Have a rather low fire, which will grad-u-al-ly
increase in heat without adding more fuel.</p>

<p>"Rules:</p>

<p>"Thin cakes require a hotter oven than larger ones.</p>

<p>"Molasses cakes will burn easily, so require a cooler
oven than others.</p>

<p>"Sponge cakes require a 'slower' oven than butter
cakes.</p>

<p>"We'll both be used!" exclaimed the Cake Pans,
joyously. "I told you so! I told you!" they cried at
each other as though having an argument.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mary Frances, "less talking. We
must get to work."</p>

<p>"Look at the oven first," said the Cake Pans, as
Mary Frances started to break the eggs.</p>

<p>"Is it right?" asked the little girl, lifting them up
to see.</p>

<p>"Yes," they said, "it will be just right when we
are ready."</p>

<p>"All the ma-ter-i-als you'll need ready?" asked
Round Cake Tin after a minute.</p>

<p>"Yes," looking over the table, "I see&mdash;everything.
Good!"</p>

<p>"I brought the butter into the warm room an hour
ago," said Mary Frances, "so that it would be softened
by the time I needed it. I'll make the sponge cake
first, as the oven will be cooler then."</p>

<p>"Right!" cried the Cake Tins; "but when you
open the oven door, be careful to do so gently, as any
jarring will break the 'gas bubbles' very easily, doing
much more harm toward making the cake heavy than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>

<p>With the Cake Tins' help, a warm and tired, but
very happy little girl brought two golden brown fragrant
cakes to the table one-half hour before lunch time.</p>

<p>"Turn us on our sides," panted the Cake Tins, "to
let us cool off quickly and evenly. My, but it was warm
in there!"</p>

<p>"How beautiful the cakes look!" said Mary
Frances, doing as she was told.</p>

<p>"Why not take a taste?" Square Cake Tin asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just before lunch time," said Mary
Frances, "and would spoil my ap-pe-tite. Mother
doesn't allow me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just one sweet mouthful?" tempted Cake Tin.</p>

<p>"It seems so good. I guess I will&mdash;just this once,"
and cutting a piece, she ate it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

</div>
<p>"What's the matter, child?" asked Aunt
Maria, anxiously. "'Homesick' for Mother?&mdash;or
was to-day's lesson too hard?"</p>

<p>Then Mary Frances told of cutting and eating the
fresh cake. "And, Aunt Maria," she said, the tears
flowing down her cheeks, "it went</p>

<div class='unindent'>until I was afraid it would rise out of the bottom of
the pan the other way."</div>



<p>"Never mind, dear child," Aunt Maria comforted
her. "I did the same thing to my first cake. I remember
it well!"</p>

<p>"You did, Aunt Maria?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old lady. "I'll tell you what we'll
do! I'll bake a cake in place of yours for to-night's
party. Don't tell any one."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Aunt Maria," cried Mary Frances;
"that's so kind!"</p>

<p>"Not a word to any one!" cau-tion-ed Aunt Maria.
"What else do you have?"</p>

<p>"Cocoa," said Mary Frances; "I can make that."</p>

<p>"My," smiled Aunt Maria, "I'm so proud."</p>

<div class='center'><b>* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>After the games and riddles, Mary Frances excused
herself from her guests, and made the cocoa and the
pot of tea for her aunt. Then Billy carried in the tray,
on which she had placed the cake, and the cups and
saucers, plates, napkins, and Chocolate Pot, and, oh,
yes, Tea Pot, for Aunt Maria; and she poured the cocoa
like a real grown lady, while the boys passed the plates
and the cake, and served the guests to the cups of cocoa.</p>

<p>"Did Mary Frances make this cake?" asked one
of the guests. ("I'm awfully glad she didn't ask about
the other," thought the little girl.)</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eleanor's brother Bob. "Yes; knowing
the greatness of the present oc-ca-sion, I have
written a poem, en-ti-tled, 'Ode to the Cook' (bowing
to Mary Frances), which, with your kind indulgence, I

<p>"Begin!" laughed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>Bob cleared his throat and began:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mary Frances is a girl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who cooks for you and I;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She can boil a fancy cake</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or stew a cherry pie.</span><br />
<br />
"Once she made a pot of soup<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And served it for our dinner;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We thought that we were like to die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It made us so much thinner."</span><br />

<p>"Mary Frances, don't mind Bob," interrupted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Eleanor. "You see what I have to stand all the time."
And Mary Frances laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Did you think I minded Bob?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Show you forgive me, Mary Frances," begged
Bob, "by letting me have another cup of cake, and
another piece of cocoa."</p>

<p>"Not <i>another</i>," laughingly corrected Mary Frances.
"To be polite, I believe I must pretend I didn't notice
you'd had any."</p>

<p>"You certainly are kind, Mary Frances," said Bob,
"when I don't know how many pieces&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," cried Eleanor,&mdash;"this makes the fifth!"</p>

<p>"Well, Nell," begged Bob, "don't tell Mother."</p>

<p>"You deserve it," said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Come," said Billy, "all ready! another game!
'Blind feeds Blind!'" And they blindfolded the boys'
eyes, and sat them opposite each other, each with a
plate of little pieces of cake, and a spoon. They were
to try to feed each other. The one who dropped the
least number of pieces, and whose cake was first gone,
won. It was very funny! Sometimes the spoon was
poked into the other boy's ear; sometimes it hit his
nose.</p>

Eleanor, "and it was the loveliest party!"</p>

<p>"I think so, too," smiled Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"One last riddle," said Mary Frances' father,
bidding the young people good-night:</p>

<p>"'Why is Mary Frances the happiest girl in the
world?'"</p>

<p>Then they all guessed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because 'Mother' is coming home to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"You are!" solemnly declared Sauce
Pan,&mdash;"I mean you are our little 'Miss'&mdash;Miss Mary
Frances."</p>

<p>"My, I feel so relieved!" said Mary Frances.
"Since that is so, I'll tell you why I'm so excited!
Mother is coming home to-day&mdash;and&mdash;I'm going to
get dinner. Isn't it lovely?"</p>

<p>"Everybody," shouted Tea Kettle, "ready!"</p>

<p>With that, every utensil in the kitchen sprang to its
queer little feet.</p>

<p>"We're all quite ready, Mistress," said Tea Kettle,
trying to make a bow, but looking very clumsy and
ri-dic-u-lous, trying at the same time to keep water
from spilling out of his nose.</p>

<p>"Thank you, everybody," said Mary Frances,
very gravely, however. "I'll not need anyone just now
but Aunty Rolling Pin. Where is she?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's out picking cherries to make a pumpkin
pie," said Sauce Pan in a loud whisper to Pie Plate.</p>

<p>"Here I am, child," Aunty Rolling Pin's voice
answered. "I can't seem to roll out. Get out of my
way&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>With that, Knife, Fork and Spoon slid to the side
of the table, and she rolled to the edge.</p>

<p>"What is it, child?" she smiled.</p>

<p>"It's the grandest thing!" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>3. Add half the cold water, stirring with a knife to form a stiff
ball. Keep this on one side of the bowl.</p>

<p>4. Stir in more water until the remaining flour forms a ball. Press
these balls together.</p>

<p>5. Roll out. Fit to pie plate. Trim off overhanging edges.</p>

</div>
<p>"That's it!" exclaimed Aunty Rolling Pin, joyously.
"I was afraid there might not be 'shortening' or lard
enough in the recipe. The whole art of making good
pastry is in having one-third as much lard as flour,
and using as little water as possible.</p>

<p>"I was afraid, too, that your mother would not put
'pastry' in the book, for when flour or starch grains
are coated in fat they are too dry to 'swell' well in
cooking, and cannot burst open. They are not, I'm
sorry to say, a very di-ges-ti-ble food."</p>

<p>"I'm glad she did, though," said Mary Frances;
"she will not often let us eat 'pastry,' but I 'spect she
im-ag-ined how pleased I'd be. I wonder why pie tastes
so good, if it isn't good for us? My, how much I have
to do! Now I'm ready!"</p>

<p>At these words, Middle-sized Bowl sprang upon
the table.</p>

<p>Measuring Cup dumped a cup of flour into it, and
ran toward the lard kettle, which was standing near.</p>

<p>"Is the salt in the flour?" asked Aunty Rolling
Pin, crit-i-cal-ly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Tea Spoon, "I put it in."</p>

<p>"Who'll measure the lard?" asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"I will!" and Measuring Cup threw it into Bowl.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Mary Frances, "and what do
I do?"</p>

<p>"You'll do enough, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin,
"before you get ready a whole big dinner, even with
our help."</p>

<p>"Well, really," said Mary Frances, "I 'spose I ought
to explain: These tarts are more 'specially for Billy
than for dinner. I promised him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Aunty Rolling Pin;
"that only makes it nicer than ever!"</p>

</div>

<p>"Now," she went on, "rub the flour and lard
together. Cover the lard with the flour. Yes, that's
it! Now, rub them together until it seems like coarse
powder. You could use a knife instead, chopping the
lard all through."</p>

<p>"That right?" asked Mary Frances, holding some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
down for Aunty Rolling Pin to look at, since she
couldn't see over the edge of Bowl.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is right," she answered. "Now, you
may use a knife for stirring and pour just a little water
in&mdash;oh, mercy! child! (as Mary Frances was about
to throw in a quarter of a glass) not that way! Make
a little 'well' in the flour. Pour in about one tablespoon
of water. Mix well. Let that rest at one side
and do the same thing in another place, and then
another, finally stirring all together into one big ball.</p>

<p>"That's just right!" as Mary Frances lifted up the
paste.</p>

<p>"Now, sift a little flour on the board and&mdash;oh, how
many tarts are you going to make?"</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>"All right. Cut the paste into five even pieces, and
with <i>me</i> (Mary Frances laughed, Aunty Rolling Pin
seemed so pleased) roll out each piece about one-eighth
of an inch thick. After cutting out, save all the left-over
trimmings to use for the last one. Plates ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready!" answered the little heart-shaped
Tart Plates.</p>

<p>"How do I make a pretty border?" asked Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Frances, cutting the trimmings from the edge of
Tart Plate with a knife held upright along the edge.</p>

<p>Fork came dancing from the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember!" said Mary Frances, pressing
the prongs into the outer edge of the crust.</p>

<p>"They're grand!" chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin.
"Can you bake them? You need a very hot oven to
bake them."</p>

<p>"But the cherries!" said Mary Frances, glad to
think she had caught Aunty Rolling Pin in an oversight.</p>

<p>"Not until the pastry's cooked, child," said Aunty
Rolling Pin, with a smile.</p>

<p>Mary Frances slipped the little plates into the oven,
and made room on the table to place the dinner as she
prepared it.</p>

<p>In a short fifteen minutes the tarts were ready.</p>

<p>"Aren't they sweet!" the little girl exclaimed.
"My! I wish they were thought to be very good for

"that's my other name, Frying Pan Spider."</p>

<p>Then to Gridiron he added, "Come, don't let's

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
